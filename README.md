# agent-conversation-reliability-pipeline
Two Pipecat-based agents join a Daily.co WebRTC room, role-play a short scenario, and autonomously exit. Built with a reliability-first architecture emphasizing correctness, deterministic flows, structured logging, and measurable metrics (latency, success rate, graceful termination) to demonstrate full pipeline understanding.
